# Roadmap

There are two major things I'd like to expand on with this project: additional functions, and additional testing. Please contact me at [davidanagy@gmail.com](mailto:davidanagy@gmail.com).

## More functions

Do you have any ideas for more useful functions? They could be entirely new, not found in other libraries, or they could be improved versions of what's already found in other libraries.

## More testing

I've done [some limited testing](https://github.com/davidanagy/lambdata-davidanagy/blob/master/lambdata_davidanagy/lambdata_test.py), but much more needs to be done, either by running a test file (or pytest) or by importing the functions and playing around with them. If you find any errors while doing those, please let me know!
